                                Suggestions of what to do were offered, the
                                paperwork needed to remove the tablet was supplied and the stone removed and replaced on
                                the grave.

                                We thought that the work involved was very hard to grind down and re type the original
                                tablet to add another name, but the result was fantastic!
                                The price was very reasonable and carried out promptly. A great local company that I
                                would highly recommend, thank you!</p>

                                recently on my mother's headstone. The
                                quality of the work is excellent. Everything was carried out as discussed and planned
                                and we were regularly informed of the progress. Communication throughout was brilliant.
                                Ben and Sam go that extra mile and are proud of their work.</p>
